; To use PSD with Scheme 48:
;  - Put (setq psd-using-slib nil) in your .emacs
;  - Put this file in psd-directory
;  - Remove (define *psd-tab-char* (integer->char 9)) from psd's read.scm
;  - Do something horrible to primitives.scm to circumvent bug in
;    Scheme 48's byte code compiler... those big long lists have to be
;    split up: `((x ,x) ... (y ,y) ...) =>
;     (let ((foo (lambda () `((x ,x) ...)))
;	    (bar (lambda () `((y ,y) ...))))
;	(append (foo) (bar)))

; JAR's remarks:
;   - The variable *PSD-PREVIOUS-LINE* was undefined (not consequentially so)
;   - It doesn't support DELAY
;   - It doesn't support the => syntax in COND
;   - It doesn't like (write-char c port):
;     ERROR: Wrong number of arguments to primitive procedure
;     write-char
;   - It would be awfully nice if there were a "quit" command
;   - It leaves that little "=>" arrow in my buffer (except it's not
;     really there, is it?)
;   - It opens the source file multiple (maybe 6) times without
;     closing it (not really a problem since the GC cleans these up, but
;     sort of annoying)

;;;; SLIB interface to load psd files.

;;;; This is the file that takes care of loading psd into the Scheme
;;;; interpreter. If you want to modify psd to work with a particular
;;;; implementation, say "foo", this is the way to do it:

;;;; 1) Make a copy of the file "psd.scm" under the name "psd-foo.scm",
;;;;    and modify it to load "primitives-foo.scm" instead of
;;;;    "primitives.scm". You can also do other things.
;;;;
;;;; 2) Make a copy of the file "primitives.scm" under the name
;;;;    "primitives-foo.scm", and modify the definitions in it to
;;;;    know about the additional primitives in your implementation
;;;;
;;;; 3) When you now set the Emacs variable scheme-program-name to
;;;;    "foo" and give the commands ``M-x run-scheme'' ``M-x psd-mode'',
;;;;    you have a psd system that knows about your additional
;;;;    primitives.

;;; this is not portable.

; Neither is this.

;;; use this definition if your system doesn't have such a procedure.

;;;; Dynamic-wind

; This is a version of dynamic-wind that tries to do "the right thing"
; in the presence of multiple threads of control.
; This definition of "the right thing" is due to Pavel Curtis, and is
; the one used in Scheme Xerox.  It is very different from what you will
; find in, say, MIT Scheme.
;
; When we want to go to a new target state (e.g. on invoking a
; continuation), we ascend to the nearest common ancestor of the
; current state and the target state, executing the "out" (or
; "unwind") thunk for each state on the way; then we climb back down
; to the target state executing the "in" thunk for each state.  Unlike
; the Hanson/Lamping algorithm, the tree of states is not altered in
; any way.
;
; Each thread starts out in the root state, but continuations capture
; the state where they're created.

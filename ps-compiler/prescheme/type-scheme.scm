; If TYPE has any variables bound at DEPTH this returns a type scheme making
; those variables polymorphic; otherwise TYPE is returned.

; Would like to do limited finalizing of uvars, but can't.
; Consider (lambda (g x) (tuple (g 3) (g x) x))
; (a -> b) -> c -> [d, e, f] with
; a > int8, d > b, a > c, e > b, f > c
; No polymorphism, and no simplification without restricting someone
; But consider NOT  a ->b, bool > a, b > bool
; It could just as well be bool -> bool.
; Simplification okay on variables that are not used inside other types?

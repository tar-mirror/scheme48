; Types and nodes together

; Instantiate TYPE and replace the types in NODE with their corresponding
; value.  LOCATION is where NODE will be applied, and is used to get the actual
; types of the arguments.

; This is used to replace all references in NODE to polymorphic type variables
; with the current value of the type variable.
; Youch!  Very inefficient - may make many copies of the same type.

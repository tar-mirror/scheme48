Part of Scheme 48 1.9.  See file COPYING for notices and license.

The following information is only a suggestion applicable to the
Scheme 48 1.9 distribution.  It constitutes neither legal advice nor
a license.

The license in file COPYING permits you and others to build on the
work found in this distribution and redistribute the resulting
work(s), as long as you meet the terms of that license.  That license
applies to material that comes from our work, not necessarily your
additions.  If you happen to like the license in COPYING, you might
consider licensing the resulting work as follows:

1. Add your own copyright notice immediately above "All rights
   reserved" in file COPYING:

   Copyright © 1986-2001 Richard Kelsey and Jonathan Rees.
   Copyright © 2001-2007 Michael Sperber and Martin Gasbichler.
   Copyright © 2007-2012 Michael Sperber and Marcus Crestani.
   Copyright © 2086 Energetic Hacker.
   All rights reserved.

2. Change occurrences of "Scheme 48 1.9" to a name of your choice when
   appropriate, e.g. in the paragraph preceding the notices and at the
   top of COPYING (but NOT in "Scheme 48 0.58 [...] was developed by
   Richard Kelsey and Jonathan Rees"!).

3. Adjust the explanations in COPYING, specifically the sentence
   starting "Scheme 48 1.9 derives" to something like this:

   Better Scheme 2.0 derives from Scheme 48 1.9.  Scheme 48 1.9
   derives from Scheme 48 0.58, which was developed by Richard Kelsey
   and Jonathan Rees and incorporates PreScheme 0.5 by Richard Kelsey.

If you've made modifications to our source files, the statement "Part
of Scheme 48 1.9" in those files will not be true of the
changed files.  Those files should be updated to say "Derived from
Scheme 48 1.9" or "Part of Better Scheme 2.0" or something
similar that is true.
